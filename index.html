            <p>Masai Mara National Reserve is one of the most popular tourism destinations in Kenya- Africa. The reserve is located in the Great Rift Valley in primarily open grassland.
               Wildlife tends to be most concentrated on the reserve’s western escarpment.
               The Masai Mara is regarded as the jewel of Kenya’s wildlife viewing areas. The annual wildebeest’s migration alone involves over 1.5 million animals arriving in July and departing in November.
               There have been some 95 species of mammals, amphibians and reptiles and over 400 birds species recorded on the reserve.</p>
